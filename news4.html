The month of August witnessed many cloudbursts and landslides in Himachal Pradesh, a
state in the Northern part of India, situated in the Western Himalayas. These incidents
wreaked havoc in the mountain regions. Many rivers overflowed, causing floods.
<br><br>
'Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief' operations run by the Indian Army saw
many people being rescued. Affected civilians were moved and treated at the Army's
medical camp. The Army also constructed a footbridge to facilitate the rescue operations.
They provided food and medicines to the distressed people in far off villages. The 
ETF (Engineer Task Force) repaired the road connecting the incident site, that was
blocked due to the landslide. They also constructed many temporary bridges to establish
connectivity between the cut off areas.
<br><br>
The Army personnel worked diligently in co-ordination with NDRF (National Disaster
Response Force), SDRF (State Disaster Response Force) and Civil Administration.
<br><br>
The IAF (Indian Air Force) also deployed their helicopters to airlift the injured to
the nearby hospitals. They also provided food and medical aid to the affected people.
That is why, our soldiers are called <i>'Devdoots'</i> in the region.

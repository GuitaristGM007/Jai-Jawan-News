The Indain Army and the Paramilitary Forces like BSF (Border Security Focre), CRPF
(Central Reserve Police Force), ITBP (Indo-Tibetan Border Police) etc. play a pivotal
role in curbing insurgency and terrorism along the borders of India. Operation Sarp
Vinash was launched in 2003 to wipe out terrorists from J&K. For many years, terrorist
groups had been building up their hideouts and bunkers in Poonch region. The Indian
Forces killed several terrorists to free the region from terror.
<br><br>
In recent times, the year 2024 again saw the rise in terror attacks in Jammu region.
Operation Sarp Vinash has been relaunched to counter the infiltration and menace of
terrorism.
<br><br>
The Indian Army along with CRPF, BSF and J&K Police Force is combing thick forests,
making good use of drones. The locals are also being made aware about the know-how of
tackling the terrorists.
<br><br>
Let us all hope that the bloodshed stops and peace returns to the Valley.

When Kerala, God's own country, was hit by twin landslides due to torrential rains,
more than 400 people lost their lives and many were rendered homeless. The Indian 
Army's valour and dedication saved many lives. Inspired by their brave, yet kind
gesture, a Grade 3 student from AMLP school, Mst. Rayan, wrote a heartfelt letter to the
Army. It wrote:
<br><br>
"Dear Indian Army, my beloved Wayanad was struck by a massive landslide, creating
havoc and destruction. I felt proud and happy to see you rescuing people who were
stuck under debris.
<br>
I just saw the video in which you are having buscuits to sate your hunger and building
a bridge. That sight moved me deeply and I aspire to join the Indian Army one day and
protect my nation."
<br><br>
The Southern Command of the Indian Army replied by thanking the 'Young Warrior' for his
courage and inspiration. They wrote:
<br><br>
"Your heartfelt words have deeply touched us. In times of adversity, we aim to be a
beacon of hope, and your letter reaffirms this mission. Heroes like you inspire us to
give our utmost. We eagerly await the day you dawn the uniform and stand alongside us.
Together, we will make our nation proud."
<br><br>
The troops including the IAF (Indian Air Force) are still indulged, being the helping
hands for the needy in Kerala.
